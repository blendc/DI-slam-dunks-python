## Development Setup

### Virtual Environment Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
- On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
- On Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Deactivate the virtual environment when done:
```bash
deactivate
```

## Quick Start
    Start Docker Desktop:
   - Open Docker.app from Applications
   - Wait for it to start (whale icon in menu bar)

3. Run the application:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

The application will be available at:
- API: http://localhost:8000
<!-- - Database: localhost:5432 -->
<!-- - Redis: localhost:6379 -->
- Flower (Celery monitoring): http://localhost:5555
